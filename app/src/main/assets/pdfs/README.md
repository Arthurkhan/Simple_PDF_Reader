# Test PDFs Directory

This directory should contain test PDF files for the app.

To add test PDFs:
1. Place PDF files in this directory (app/src/main/assets/pdfs/)
2. The app will automatically detect them in the "Test PDFs" dialog

Example PDFs you could add:
- sample.pdf
- test-document.pdf
- user-manual.pdf

Note: Due to GitHub limitations, actual PDF files need to be added manually to your local project.

## Creating a Test PDF

You can create a simple test PDF using online tools or any text editor that can export to PDF:
1. Create a document with some text
2. Save/Export as PDF
3. Place in this directory

The app will list all PDF files found in this directory when you tap the "Test PDFs" button.
