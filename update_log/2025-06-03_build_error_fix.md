# Simple PDF Reader - Update Log

## 2025-06-03: Build Error Fix - PDF Viewer Dependency

### Task Description
Fix build errors preventing the app from compiling. The build was failing because it couldn't resolve the PDF viewer library dependency.

### Implementation Details
- Identified that the app uses `com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer` library for PDF rendering
- The build was failing because version `3.2.0-beta.1` doesn't exist
- Updated to stable version `2.8.2` which is available on JitPack
- Confirmed JitPack repository was already configured in `settings.gradle`

### Files Modified/Created
- `app/build.gradle` - Changed PDF viewer dependency from version `3.2.0-beta.1` to `2.8.2`

### Testing Notes
- Clean and rebuild the project
- The app should now compile successfully
- Test PDF loading functionality to ensure the library works correctly

### Status
âœ… Complete

### Next Steps
- Build and test the app to ensure PDF viewing works properly
- Consider documenting that the app uses the barteksc PDF viewer library, not native PdfRenderer as stated in docs
- If needed, could migrate to native PdfRenderer in future for better alignment with documentation

### Notes
The project documentation states the app uses Android's native PdfRenderer, but the actual implementation uses the barteksc AndroidPdfViewer library. This library provides better features like clickable links and smoother scrolling, which explains why it was chosen over the native option.
