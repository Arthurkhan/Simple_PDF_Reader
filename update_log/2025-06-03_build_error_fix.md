# Simple PDF Reader - Update Log

## 2025-06-03: Build Error Fix - PDF Viewer Dependency

### Task Description
Fix build errors preventing the app from compiling. The build was failing because it couldn't resolve the PDF viewer library dependency.

### Implementation Details
- Identified that the app uses `com.github.barteksc:android-pdf-viewer` library for PDF rendering
- The build was failing because:
  1. Version `3.2.0-beta.1` doesn't exist
  2. Version `2.8.2` returns 401 Unauthorized on JitPack
  3. The package name format was incorrect for JitPack
- Fixed by using the correct JitPack format: `com.github.barteksc:AndroidPdfViewer:3.1.0-beta.1`
  - Note the capital 'A' and 'V' in AndroidPdfViewer
- Fixed compilation error for non-existent `fitEachPage()` method
  - Removed `.fitEachPage(true)` calls from both PDF loading methods
  - The library handles page fitting automatically with `autoSpacing(true)`
- Confirmed JitPack repository was already configured in `settings.gradle`

### Files Modified/Created
- `app/build.gradle` - Changed PDF viewer dependency from `android-pdf-viewer:3.2.0-beta.1` to `AndroidPdfViewer:3.1.0-beta.1`
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/MainActivity.kt` - Removed `.fitEachPage(true)` calls (lines 206 and 298)

### Testing Notes
- Clean and rebuild the project
- The app should now compile successfully
- Test PDF loading functionality to ensure the library works correctly
- Verify clickable links in PDFs work as expected
- Check that PDFs display properly with automatic page fitting

### Status
âœ… Complete

### Next Steps
- Build and test the app to ensure PDF viewing works properly
- Consider documenting that the app uses the barteksc AndroidPdfViewer library, not native PdfRenderer as stated in docs
- If stability issues occur with beta version, consider using `master-SNAPSHOT` or migrating to native PdfRenderer

### Notes
The project documentation states the app uses Android's native PdfRenderer, but the actual implementation uses the barteksc AndroidPdfViewer library. This library provides better features like clickable links and smoother scrolling, which explains why it was chosen over the native option.

The issue was caused by:
1. Using an incorrect package name format for JitPack
2. Attempting to use non-existent versions
3. JitPack authorization issues with certain versions
4. Using non-existent API methods from older documentation
