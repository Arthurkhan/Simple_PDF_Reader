# Simple PDF Reader - Update Log

## 2025-06-03: PDF Loading Issues Debug

### Task Description
Fix PDF loading issues in the simulator where PDFs are not displaying.

### Implementation Details
Added comprehensive debugging and fixed several potential issues:

1. **Enhanced AndroidManifest.xml**
   - Added intent filter to handle PDF files from other apps
   - Added `requestLegacyExternalStorage` for better compatibility
   - Limited READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE to SDK 32 and below (not needed for SAF)

2. **Added Extensive Logging**
   - Added TAG constant for consistent logging
   - Log entries at every major step of PDF loading process
   - Detailed error logging with specific error messages
   - Success confirmations when PDFs load

3. **Improved Error Handling**
   - Better error messages for different failure scenarios
   - Permission error detection
   - File not found detection
   - Asset file existence checking

4. **UI State Management**
   - Added `updateUIForContent()` and `updateUIForNoContent()` methods
   - Proper UI updates when PDFs load or fail
   - Favorite button visibility management

5. **Fixed Issues**
   - Properly handle menu visibility after PDF loads
   - Ensure loading progress is hidden on both success and failure
   - Check asset file existence before trying to copy

### Files Modified/Created
- `app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added PDF intent filters and legacy storage support
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/MainActivity.kt` - Added extensive logging and improved error handling
- `app/src/main/assets/pdfs/README.md` - Updated with instructions for adding test PDFs

### Troubleshooting Steps

1. **Check Logcat Output**
   - Filter by tag "PDFReader" to see all debug messages
   - Look for error messages that indicate the specific problem

2. **Common Issues and Solutions**:

   **No test PDFs available:**
   - Add PDF files to `app/src/main/assets/pdfs/` directory
   - Rebuild the project after adding PDFs

   **Permission Denied:**
   - The app uses Storage Access Framework, no permissions needed
   - If you see permission errors, check the URI access

   **PDF not displaying but no errors:**
   - Check if the PDF library is properly initialized
   - Verify the PDF file is valid and not corrupted
   - Check memory usage - large PDFs may cause issues

   **Blank screen after selecting PDF:**
   - Check Logcat for "PDF loaded successfully" message
   - Verify the number of pages reported
   - The PDF might be loading but rendering incorrectly

3. **Testing Recommendations**
   - Start with small, simple PDF files
   - Test with PDFs from different sources
   - Use the file picker to select PDFs from Downloads
   - Add test PDFs to assets folder for consistent testing

4. **Debug Output to Check**
   ```
   D/PDFReader: Opening file picker
   D/PDFReader: PDF picker result: content://...
   D/PDFReader: Loading PDF from URI: content://...
   D/PDFReader: Starting PDF load...
   D/PDFReader: PDF loaded successfully. Pages: X
   ```

### Status
âœ… Complete - Added debugging capabilities

### Next Steps
1. Run the app and check Logcat for specific error messages
2. Add test PDF files to the assets/pdfs directory
3. If issues persist, check the PDF library version compatibility
4. Consider adding a simple PDF creation utility for testing

### Notes
- The app uses AndroidPdfViewer library which requires valid PDF files
- Large PDFs may take time to load and render
- The library version 3.1.0-beta.1 may have some stability issues
- Consider downgrading to a stable version if problems persist
