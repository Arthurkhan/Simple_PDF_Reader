# Simple PDF Reader - Update Log

## 2025-06-03: Interactive PDF Links Support

### Task Description
User requested to make PDF links and buttons functional in the app. The current implementation used Android's native PdfRenderer which only renders PDFs as static images, making links non-clickable.

### Implementation Details
- Replaced Android's native PdfRenderer with AndroidPdfViewer library (barteksc:android-pdf-viewer)
- AndroidPdfViewer provides built-in support for interactive PDF elements including clickable links
- Implemented custom LinkHandler to handle both external URLs and internal PDF page links
- Maintained all existing features including favorites, lock mode, and test PDFs

### Technical Changes
1. **Library Migration**:
   - Removed dependency on PhotoView (no longer needed)
   - Added AndroidPdfViewer dependency (version 3.2.0-beta.1)
   - Library supports interactive elements, annotations, and better PDF rendering

2. **UI Updates**:
   - Replaced RecyclerView with PDFView component
   - PDFView handles continuous scrolling internally
   - Maintained same UI behavior (hidden controls when viewing PDF)

3. **Link Handling**:
   - External links open in default browser
   - Internal PDF links navigate to the specified page
   - Error handling for unsupported link types

### Files Modified/Created
- `app/build.gradle` - Updated dependencies to include AndroidPdfViewer
- `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml` - Replaced RecyclerView with PDFView
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/MainActivity.kt` - Complete rewrite of PDF rendering logic

### Files Marked for Deletion
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/adapters/PdfPagesAdapter.kt` - No longer needed (restored temporarily due to build issue)
- `app/src/main/res/layout/item_pdf_page.xml` - RecyclerView item layout no longer needed (restored temporarily due to build issue)

**Note**: The above files were initially emptied but this caused build errors. They have been restored with minimal content. Please manually delete these files from your local repository after syncing.

### Build Fix
If you encounter a "Premature end of file" error, sync your project and then manually delete:
1. `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/adapters/PdfPagesAdapter.kt`
2. `app/src/main/res/layout/item_pdf_page.xml`

### Testing Notes
- Test with PDFs containing various link types:
  - External URLs (http/https links)
  - Internal page references
  - Email links (mailto:)
  - Form buttons and interactive elements
- Verify all existing features still work:
  - File selection and favorites
  - Lock mode functionality
  - Test PDFs from assets
  - Immersive viewing experience

### Status
âœ… Complete

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any performance differences with large PDFs
- Consider adding additional PDF features that AndroidPdfViewer supports:
  - Search within PDF
  - Page thumbnails
  - Bookmarks support
  - Annotation rendering
