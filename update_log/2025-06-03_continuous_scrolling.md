# Simple PDF Reader - Update Log

## 2025-06-03: Continuous Vertical Scrolling (Manwha/Webtoon Style)

### Task Description
Implement continuous vertical scrolling like manwha/webtoon reading apps where all PDF pages are displayed one under the other without any spacing or separation. Users can scroll smoothly through the entire document as if it's one long continuous page.

### Implementation Details
- Replaced single-page PhotoView with RecyclerView for continuous scrolling
- Created custom adapter to display all PDF pages vertically
- Removed all page navigation controls (arrows, page info) - scrolling is the navigation
- Maintained zoom functionality on individual pages using PhotoView in each item
- Implemented efficient page loading with all pages rendered at once
- Ensured seamless display with no gaps between pages

### Files Modified/Created
- `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`:
  - Replaced PhotoView with RecyclerView
  - Removed navigation controls completely
  - Added loading progress indicator
  
- `app/src/main/res/layout/item_pdf_page.xml` (NEW):
  - Created item layout for individual PDF pages
  - Uses PhotoView for zoom functionality per page
  - Set to wrap_content height for proper aspect ratio
  
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/adapters/PdfPagesAdapter.kt` (NEW):
  - RecyclerView adapter for PDF pages
  - Handles bitmap display and recycling
  - Sets minimum zoom to fill screen width
  - Manages memory efficiently with view recycling
  
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/MainActivity.kt`:
  - Added RecyclerView setup with LinearLayoutManager
  - Implemented `loadAllPages()` to render all PDF pages at once
  - Removed all navigation-related code
  - Added loading progress during PDF rendering
  - Modified to hide all UI when viewing PDFs

### Technical Decisions
- **RecyclerView**: Chosen for efficient memory management with view recycling
- **All Pages Loading**: Load all pages at once for seamless scrolling (like manwha apps)
- **PhotoView per Page**: Each page maintains zoom functionality independently
- **No Gaps**: Used wrap_content height and no item decorations for seamless flow
- **Width-based Zoom**: Minimum zoom fills screen width, allowing vertical scroll

### Testing Notes
- Test with multi-page PDFs to verify smooth scrolling
- Check memory usage with large PDFs (50+ pages)
- Verify zoom works on individual pages
- Ensure no gaps appear between pages
- Test scrolling performance and smoothness

### Status
âœ… Complete

### Next Steps
- Consider lazy loading for very large PDFs (100+ pages)
- Could add page position indicator (1/10, 2/10, etc.)
- May want to add double-tap to zoom functionality
- Consider adding smooth scroll to page feature
- Could implement page caching for better memory management
