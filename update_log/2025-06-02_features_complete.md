### Known Limitations

1. **Google Drive Integration**: Currently only supports local storage. Google Drive integration would require:
   - Google Sign-In
   - Drive API implementation
   - Additional permissions

2. **Lock Mode**: The full kiosk mode requires device owner privileges for complete lockdown. Current implementation provides basic lock functionality.

3. **PDF Features**: Basic rendering only. Advanced features like:
   - Text search
   - Annotations
   - Zoom/pan gestures
   - Bookmarks
   Would require more complex implementation or third-party libraries.

### Testing Recommendations

1. Test on various Android tablets (9.0+)
2. Test with different PDF sizes and formats
3. Verify favorites persistence across app restarts
4. Test lock mode behavior with different system buttons
5. Check memory usage with large PDFs

### Future Enhancements (if needed)

1. Add pinch-to-zoom functionality
2. Implement Google Drive integration
3. Add PDF thumbnail previews in favorites
4. Support for password-protected PDFs
5. Recent files list
6. Landscape/portrait optimization
7. Page jump dialog for large PDFs

### Deployment

1. Generate signed APK in Android Studio
2. Test on target devices
3. Consider ProGuard optimization for release
4. Upload to Google Play Store or distribute APK directly
