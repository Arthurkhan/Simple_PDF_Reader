## 2025-06-03: Immersive PDF Viewing

### Task Description
Remove all UI elements when viewing PDFs to create a completely immersive experience. The PDF should fill the entire screen with no black bars, no navigation UI, no FAB buttons, and no system bars visible. Only the PDF content should be displayed.

### Implementation Details
- Separated navigation controls from PDF container in layout for independent visibility control
- Added system UI immersive mode to hide status bar and navigation bar
- Implemented tap-to-toggle navigation for multi-page PDFs
- Hide all UI elements (FAB menu, favorites button, navigation) when PDF is loaded
- Added black background to PhotoView to ensure no white edges
- Implemented proper back button handling to close PDF and return to menu
- Single-page PDFs have no navigation UI at all

### Files Modified/Created
- `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`:
  - Moved navigation controls outside of PDF container
  - Made navigation controls a separate ConstraintLayout element
  - Removed semi-transparent background from navigation
  
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/MainActivity.kt`:
  - Added `hideSystemUI()` function for immersive mode with sticky flags
  - Added `onWindowFocusChanged()` to maintain immersive mode
  - Modified `loadPdf()` and `loadPdfFromAssets()` to hide all UI elements
  - Added tap listener to PhotoView to toggle navigation visibility
  - Added `toggleNavigationVisibility()` function for multi-page PDFs
  - Added `closePdf()` function to properly handle back button
  - Set black background on PhotoView to eliminate any edge artifacts
  - Navigation only appears for multi-page PDFs when tapped

### Technical Decisions
- **Immersive Mode**: Used `SYSTEM_UI_FLAG_IMMERSIVE_STICKY` to keep system bars hidden
- **Tap Navigation**: Only enabled for multi-page PDFs to avoid unnecessary UI
- **Black Background**: Ensures no white edges appear around PDFs
- **Back Button**: When PDF is open, back button closes PDF instead of exiting app
- **UI Hiding**: All UI elements hidden immediately when PDF loads for instant immersion

### Testing Notes
- Test with PDFs of different sizes and aspect ratios
- Verify no black bars or white edges appear
- Test tap-to-toggle navigation on multi-page PDFs
- Verify single-page PDFs have no navigation option
- Test back button behavior when PDF is open vs closed
- Verify system bars stay hidden during PDF viewing

### Status
âœ… Complete

### Next Steps
- Consider adding swipe gestures for page navigation
- Could add long-press to show quick actions (share, info)
- May want to add pinch-to-close gesture
- Consider adding page thumbnails preview on long press
