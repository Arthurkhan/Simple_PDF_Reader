## 2025-06-03: Fix Zoom Feature - Dynamic Width Adaptation

### Task Description
Fix the extremely zoomed-in issue by implementing proper dynamic adaptation to PDF page width. The zoom calculation was not accounting for the rendering resolution, causing pages to appear too zoomed in.

### Implementation Details
- Fixed zoom calculation in adapter to account for PhotoView's internal scaling
- Changed from fixed 2x rendering to dynamic resolution based on screen width
- Implemented proper fit-to-width calculation relative to PhotoView's base scale
- Ensured PDFs render at optimal resolution for each device's screen

### Files Modified
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/adapters/PdfPagesAdapter.kt`:
  - Rewrote zoom calculation to work with PhotoView's internal fitCenter scale
  - Calculate fit-to-width scale relative to base scale
  - Set initial zoom to exactly fit screen width
  
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/MainActivity.kt`:
  - Added DisplayMetrics to get actual screen dimensions
  - Changed from fixed 2x rendering to dynamic scale calculation
  - Render each page at exact screen width for optimal quality
  - Calculate render dimensions based on screen width and PDF aspect ratio

### Technical Decisions
- **Dynamic Rendering**: Instead of fixed 2x scale, calculate exact pixel dimensions needed
- **PhotoView Scale**: Work with PhotoView's internal scaling mechanism rather than against it
- **Screen-based Sizing**: Use actual screen width to determine optimal render size
- **Memory Efficiency**: Render at exactly the resolution needed, no more

### Testing Notes
- Test with PDFs of various widths (narrow, standard, wide)
- Verify pages fit screen width by default
- Check zoom in/out functionality works smoothly
- Test on different screen sizes and densities
- Monitor memory usage with large PDFs

### Status
âœ… Complete

### Next Steps
- Consider adding render quality settings (low/medium/high)
- Could implement smart rendering based on available memory
- May want to add double-tap to reset zoom
- Consider progressive rendering for very large PDFs
