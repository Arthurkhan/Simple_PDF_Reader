# Simple PDF Reader - Update Log

## 2025-06-04: Fix PDF Loading Issues

### Task Description
User reported that PDFs load forever and don't display. Need to debug and fix the PDF rendering functionality.

### Implementation Details
- Updated AndroidPdfViewer library from beta version 3.1.0-beta.1 to 3.2.0-beta.1 for better stability
- Added improved error handling with more descriptive error messages
- Simplified PDF loading configuration by removing complex options that might cause issues
- Added coroutine support with proper context switching for file operations
- Improved logging to help debug PDF loading issues
- Added better error messages that distinguish between different types of failures (permissions, file not found, corrupted files)

### Files Modified/Created
- `app/build.gradle` - Updated AndroidPdfViewer dependency to more stable version
- `app/src/main/java/com/simplepdf/reader/MainActivity.kt` - Major refactoring:
  - Added coroutine support with proper Dispatchers
  - Simplified PDF loading configuration (disabled annotation rendering)
  - Improved error handling with specific error messages
  - Added more detailed logging throughout the loading process
  - Fixed potential UI threading issues

### Technical Decisions
- Kept the AndroidPdfViewer library instead of switching to native PdfRenderer because:
  - The library is already integrated and provides interactive features
  - It supports clickable links which was a requirement
  - The issue was likely with the beta version or configuration, not the library itself
- Used coroutines for better async handling of file operations
- Disabled some advanced features (like annotation rendering) that might cause loading issues

### Testing Notes
- Test with various PDF files of different sizes
- Test with PDFs from different sources (local files, downloads, cloud storage)
- Check that error messages are clear when:
  - File doesn't exist
  - No permission to access file
  - Corrupted PDF file
- Verify that the loading progress indicator shows and hides correctly

### Status
âœ… Complete

### Next Steps
- Monitor for any remaining PDF loading issues
- Consider adding a timeout mechanism if PDFs still take too long to load
- If issues persist, consider implementing a fallback to Android's native PdfRenderer
- Add PDF caching mechanism to improve performance for frequently accessed files

### Notes
The main issue was likely caused by the beta version of the library or overly complex configuration options. The simplified approach with better error handling should resolve most loading issues. The improved logging will help diagnose any remaining problems.
